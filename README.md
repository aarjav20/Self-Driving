# Self-Driving-Car
This is a Self Driving Car Model which makes steering angle prediction with utmost precision. It also also highlights
the difference between the Basic lane detection and Advanced lane detection. The module for vehicle detection on tracks is also integrated.

### Technology Used : 
- Tensorflow: Tensorflow is an open source library. It is an extensive tool to
develop machine learning programs.
- Keras : Keras framework is used to build the model. 
- For pre-processing and image augmentation , OpenCV is used.
- Deep Learning based techniques is used to simulate the model and to train
the car on the image and video dataset.

### Data Collection
Two different types of dataset is used for model training:
1. The first dataset which we have used for this project consist of 63,000 images.
It was 3.3 GB in size . It was recorded in California.
2. The second dataset consists of 46,000 images, 2.3GB. Data was recorded in
one of the driving tracks of California.

### Result
The Architecture deployed to train the model gave satisfactory results. The steering angle prediction is almost accurate on the
roads while giving angles of curves with utmost precision. The Model shows a clear
contrast between the two cases of lane finding : 
- Basic lane finding 
- Advanced lane finding
